# Todo Application with Bootstrap and Vanilla JS

This project is a todo application built using Bootstrap and vanilla JavaScript. It demonstrates the use of modern web development techniques including web components, local storage for data persistence, and a simulated maintenance mode feature.

## Features

- Add, toggle, and delete todo items
- Set priority levels for tasks
- Sort tasks by priority or date
- Clear completed tasks
- Local storage persistence
- Maintenance mode simulation

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 with Bootstrap 5
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- Web Components
- Local Storage API

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser

## Maintenance Mode

To simulate the maintenance mode:

1. Click the "Toggle Maintenance Mode" button at the bottom of the page
2. An overlay will appear, indicating that the site is under maintenance
3. Click "Exit Maintenance Mode" to return to the normal view

This simulates the behavior of checking for a `/static/isUnderMaintenance.json` file and displaying an overlay when it exists.
